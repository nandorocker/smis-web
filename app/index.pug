        h1 Hello
        p I’m Zuzanna Rajewska, a Berlin-based designer with a background in Fine Arts, passionate and inspired by minimal and modern design. I have an eye for color, styles and trends, with focus on functionality and accessibility.
        p My interest in UI/UX comes from the combination of design, technology and psychology to make great products that improve people’s lives. I’m also a budding developer (web and Android so far).
        p I've done some work for big brands like Microsoft and eBay, as well as renowned underground bands and venues. Projects include design of event materials, icons, banners, posters, album artwork and more.
        p Like what you see? #[a(href="mailto:talk@rajewska.com") Let's work together!]
