        h1 Hello
        p I’m Zuzanna Rajewska, a Berlin-based designer with a background in Fine Arts, passionate and inspired by minimal and modern design. I have an eye for color, styles and trends, with focus on functionality and accessibility.
        p My interest in UI/UX is in the combination of design, technology and psychology to make great products that improve people’s lives. I’m also a budding developer (web and Android so far).
        p I've done some work for big brands like Microsoft and eBay, as well as renowned underground bands and venues. Projects include design of event materials, icons, banners, posters, album artwork and more.
        p Like what you see? #[a(href="mailto:talk@rajewska.com") Let's work together!]

          h2 Skarabeos Application Design
          p #[a(href="https://www.skarabeos.com", target="_blank") Skarabeos] designs fashionable bags with a pickpocketing and theft protection system, via mobile and watch apps—which #[a(href="http://oxcollective.com", target="_blank") Ox Collective] were tasked to create. As part of the team, I took part in the design sprint, helping come up with the app's functionality from scratch, then creating wireframes. My visual research and moodboards set the art direction for the final app design.

          h2 Google Developer Scholarship
          p To become a better UX designer, I wanted to get closer to applications by learning how to code them. Combined with my interest in Material Design, I got accepted into the #[a(href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships", target="_blank") Google Udacity Scholarship for Android Basic] course. Without any previous coding experience, in 3 months I learned the basics of Android Studio, designed and developed my first simple applications and was among the #[b 10% of students selected for the second phase] (which I'm currently attending). The code is available on #[a(href="https://github.com/rajewska?tab=repositories", target="_blank") GitHub].
